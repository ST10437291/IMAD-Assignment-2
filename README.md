The app consists of five well chosen True/False questions, displayed neatly with TextViews and interact seamlessly with the Buttons. It scores your answer as you enter it, provides you with an overall score, and builds a score history so you can focus on the areas you need to improve. Upon completion you have the option to REVIEW YOUR ANSWERS and forget what the correct answer to any question, and on the Score Screen to see your answers along with your grade. It offers a simple yet effective way to study history and was developed using kotlin in Android Studio.
